# Granite-DiagTools
An AI Powered Diagnosis tool by Granite. helps you with the problems in  your devices :)

Contents :
- Single-Shot : A program to generate code for the main Streamlit program, based on a single example that set as the reference for Granite AI
Usually this Single-shot is used to make a slightly different version of the already existing code, with some minor tweaks, with no intention to make another example materials

- Multi-Shot : Same as Single shot, this program is also used to buld the Main program. but this one has more Examples set as reference
Multi-shot is more used to build the code, because i dont have a good code to set as an example.
Multi-shot is also good to use if you want to add some features, because the code is more consistent with the examples

- Streamlit : The main program, build purely with Code that generated by the Granite AI themselves
this folder contain the main diagnosis tool, and the final product of this project
the tool runs by analyzing the user input, such as the product type, brand and model, common symptoms, and additional information from the user.
then, the information is given to the AI with a spesific format, ensuring a clean output
each diagnosis history is saved locally as the JSON file, so that it can be accesed again even when the programs is starting over again
utilizing CRUD operations to read, save and alter the saved history

how to run?
